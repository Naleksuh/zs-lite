This plugin aims to give new server owners something to run if they wish to create a zombie server.
My main zombie plugin which I've spent over two years perfecting and refining is not publicly
available to download for obvious reasons, but this plugin will allow you to run a very basic zombie server
to get you started, or learning to create your own plugins. I have tried to describe what all lines
of code do in the best detail I can.

My main zombie server can be found running on the IP address pvp1.zs.naleksuh.com, and it contains
the following features not found here:

* Zombies are chosen before setup ends
* *A lot* of glitch and exploit fixes (sometimes zombies will not be swapped to melee, you can rejoin red after dying with some cleverness, and a few more)
* Time left is visible to players
* Lots of special and bonus rounds, to keep things interesting
* Zombies can doublejump, making dispenser boosting a lot more fair
* Maps do not have dead ends (for instance you will not have a fun time playing cp_5gorge with this plugin)
* Queued algorithm that can pick multiple zombies fairly instead of a single zombie at random
* Bots to allow you to play even when the server is empty
* Occasional fixed server crashes that this plugin may crash
* And so many more things! But it doesn't mean this plugin is *bad*, I've simply created this to allow starting server owners to get started without either
having to learn SourcePawn themselves or giving away years of code
