This plugin aims to give new server owners something to run if they wish to create a zombie server.
My main zombie plugin which I've spent years perfecting and refining is not publicly
available to download for obvious reasons, but this plugin will allow you to run a very basic zombie server
to get you started, or learning to create your own plugins. I have tried to describe what all lines
of code do in the best detail I can.

My main zombie server can be found running on the IP address pvp1.zs.naleksuh.com, and it contains
the following features not found here:

* Zombies are picked before setup ends
* A LOT of glitch and exploit fixes (sometimes zombies will not be swapped to melee, you can rejoin red after dying with some cleverness, and a few more)
* Time left is visible to players
* Some rounds are unusual and slightly different than normal (to keep things fresh for experienced players)
* Zombies can double jump, making dispenser boosting a lot more fair
* Maps do not have dead ends (for instance you will not have a fun time playing cp_5gorge with this plugin)
* Queued algorithm that can pick multiple zombies fairly instead of a single zombie at random
* Bots to allow you to play even when the server is empty
* Occasional fixed server crashes that this plugin may crash
* And so many more things! But it doesn't mean this plugin is *bad*, I've simply created this to allow starting server owners to get started without either
having to learn SourcePawn themselves or giving away years of code with no benefit to my community
